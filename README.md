# **BlockFund - Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform**

## **Inspiration**
Traditional crowdfunding platforms like **Kickstarter** and **GoFundMe** charge **high platform fees** and impose **regional restrictions**, limiting access to funding for many individuals worldwide. 

**BlockFund** was created to:
- **Eliminate high platform fees** ‚Äì No intermediaries taking large cuts.
- **Enable global participation** ‚Äì Anyone, anywhere, can create or support campaigns.
- **Ensure transparency** ‚Äì All transactions are **on-chain**, preventing fraud or fund mismanagement.

## **Features**
**Decentralized & Transparent** ‚Äì No centralized authority; everything is governed by smart contracts.  
**Ethereum-based Crowdfunding** ‚Äì Fundraising without intermediaries or regional restrictions.  
**Metamask Wallet Integration** ‚Äì Secure login and transactions using Web3 wallets.  
**Smart Contract Fund Escrow** ‚Äì Funds are locked in the contract and only released to campaign creators after the campaign ends.  
**Donor & Campaign Owner Roles** ‚Äì Users can create fundraising campaigns or donate to existing ones.  
**Low Transaction Costs** ‚Äì Minimal gas fees compared to Web2 platforms' high commission rates.

## **How It Works**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Campaign**
- Users connect their **Ethereum wallet** via Metamask.
- They enter **title, description, funding goal, deadline, and image URL**.
- The smart contract **stores campaign details on-chain**.
- A unique campaign ID is assigned.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Donating to a Campaign**
- Users browse campaigns and choose one to support.
- Donations are sent in **ETH** directly to the smart contract.
- The donation details are **permanently stored** on the blockchain.
- The donor receives **proof of contribution**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Withdrawing Funds**
- Once the campaign deadline passes, the **campaign creator can withdraw the funds**.
- The contract ensures that **only the campaign owner** can withdraw.
- If the goal is not met, a **refund system** can be implemented (future improvement).
